## About The Project

From word problems, to calculus, to even physics, the AI Math Solver has you covered. It is a website powered by Gemini AI and its code execution abilities allow it to solve problems from a variety of topics.

### How it Works:

-   Users upload an image containing math problems
-   Users select a problem from the image to solve
-   AI Math Solver prompts Gemini for a solution
-   Gemini comes up with a solution and writes code to perform calculations

### Built With

This project was built with React and Next.js.

## Why I Built This

While LLMs like ChatGPT and Gemini already have math problem solving capabilities, their calculations are often inaccurate. To combat this, I used Gemini AI's math solving in tandem with code generation. This project improves upon Gemini AI's original math capabilities by incorporating code execution to improve the accuracy of its calculations.

## Getting Started

To set up this project locally, follow the following steps.

### Prerequisites

Here are the prerequisites required for this project.
